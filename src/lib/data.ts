export const BUYING_GUIDES = {
  olympic: {
    title: 'How to Choose the Perfect Olympic Barbell',
    content: `An Olympic barbell is essential for serious weightlifting training. Here's what to consider when choosing your Olympic bar:\n\n**Tensile Strength**: Look for bars with at least 190,000 PSI for durability and resistance to bending under heavy loads.\n\n**Knurl Pattern**: Olympic bars typically have moderate knurling. Some prefer sharper knurling for maximal deadlifts, while others prefer lighter patterns for Olympic movements.\n\n**Shaft Diameter**: Standard Olympic bars have a 28mm shaft diameter. Some brands offer 28.5mm or 29mm options for those who prefer a thicker grip.\n\n**Coating**: Common options include zinc, chrome, black oxide, and cerakote. Each offers different levels of grip and corrosion resistance.\n\n**Sleeve Rotation**: Quality bushings or bearings ensure smooth sleeve rotation, essential for Olympic lifts.\n\n**Budget**: Olympic bars range from $100 to $800+. Higher-priced bars offer better steel quality, more consistent manufacturing, and longer warranties.\n\nAt BarbellNearMe, we recommend starting with a bar from Rogue, Eleiko, or REP for the best combination of quality and value.`

  powerlifting: {
    title: 'The Ultimate Guide to Powerlifting Barbells',
    content: `Powerlifting requires specialized equipment designed for maximal loads. Here's your comprehensive guide:\n\n**Tensile Strength**: Power bars should have 200,000+ PSI to handle heavy training and competition attempts.\n\n**Shaft Diameter**: Most powerlifting bars use a 29mm shaft, though some prefer 28.5mm or 30mm. The thicker the shaft, the more grip but less hand flexibility.\n\n**Knurl Pattern**: Power bars feature aggressive, deep knurling to maximize grip during maximal attempts. Look for center knurling if you do squats.\n\n**Sleeve Rotation**: Bushings are standard for power bars, providing stability and consistent rotation without the spin of bearing-based bars.\n\n**Whip**: Less whip is generally preferred for powerlifting, as it provides more precise control during maximal attempts.\n\n**IPF vs. USAPL Compliance**: If competing, ensure your bar meets your federation's specifications. IPF-approved bars have specific requirements for knurl marking and shaft diameter.\n\n**Price Range**: Quality power bars range from $300 to $800. The investment is worthwhile for serious competitors.`

  crossfit: {
    title: 'CrossFit Barbell Guide: What You Need to Know',
    content: `CrossFit requires a versatile barbell that can handle everything from heavy lifts to fast Olympic movements. Here's what makes a great CrossFit bar:\n\n**Versatility**: The best CrossFit bars perform well for both heavy lifting and high-rep metabolic conditioning work.\n\n**Knurl Pattern**: Look for moderate knurling - aggressive enough for deadlifts and cleans, but not so sharp that it tears your hands during high-rep work.\n\n**Shaft Diameter**: 28mm is the CrossFit standard, providing a comfortable grip for all hand sizes.\n\n**Sleeve Rotation**: Quality bearings ensure quick, smooth rotation for Olympic movements without binding under heavy loads.\n\n**Durability**: CrossFit boxes need bars that can withstand constant use by multiple athletes. Look for reputable brands with good warranties.\n\n**Coating**: Black zinc or cerakote finishes hide chalk and wear better than chrome, maintaining a professional appearance.\n\n**Popular Options**: The Rogue Ohio Bar and Eleiko Sport Training Bar are benchmarks in the CrossFit community for their reliability and performance.`

  women: {
    title: "Women's Barbell Guide: Find Your Perfect Fit",
    content: `Women's barbells are specifically designed for female athletes' physiology and training needs. Here's what makes them different:\n\n**Weight**: Standard women's bars weigh 15kg (33lb), compared to 20kg (45lb) for men's bars.\n\n**Shaft Diameter**: Women's bars typically have a 24-25mm shaft diameter, making them easier to grip for smaller hands.\n\n**Knurl Height**: The knurling is lower to accommodate the smaller grip span of most female athletes.\n\n**Sleeve Length**: Women's bars have slightly shorter sleeves to accommodate the shorter loadable sleeve length.\n\n**Applications**: Women's bars are used for Olympic weightlifting competitions, CrossFit, and general strength training.\n\n**Brands We Recommend**: Rogue, Eleiko, and CAP all make quality women's bars at various price points.\n\n**Considerations**: Some female athletes prefer men's bars for deadlifting or powerlifting, as the larger diameter can actually be easier to grip for certain movements. Consider your training goals when choosing.`
