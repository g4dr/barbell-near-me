# Complete Strength Training Program Guide

Developing genuine strength requires more than casual gym attendance—it demands a structured **strength training program** following proven principles of periodization, progressive overload, and recovery. This guide provides everything you need to build the strongest version of yourself.

## Foundational Principles of Strength Training

### Progressive Overload
The most critical principle for strength development involves systematically increasing demands on your muscles over time:
- Add weight to the bar
- Increase repetitions with the same weight
- Improve range of motion
- Reduce rest periods
- Increase training density

### Specificity
Training adaptations are specific to the training stimulus. To get stronger at specific movements, you must practice those movements regularly.

### Individualization
Every athlete responds differently to training. What works for your training partner may not work for you. Track your progress and adjust accordingly.

## Essential Strength Exercises

### The Big Four Lifts

**Squat**
The king of lower body development. A strong squat builds powerful legs, hips, and core while improving athletic performance.
- Targets: Quads, glutes, hamstrings, lower back
- Variations: Back squat, front squat, pause squat, tempo squat

**Bench Press**
The most popular upper body strength movement, developing chest, shoulders, and triceps.
- Targets: Chest, front delts, triceps
- Variations: Competition bench, close-grip, incline, paused

**Deadlift**
Develops total body strength like no other exercise, particularly the posterior chain.
- Targets: Hamstrings, glutes, lower back, traps, grip
- Variations: Conventional, sumo, deficit, Romanian

**Overhead Press**
Builds strong, capable shoulders and triceps while demanding core stability.
- Targets: Shoulders, triceps, upper chest, core
- Variations: Standing press, seated press, push press, dumbbell press

### Accessory Movements
Supplement your main lifts with targeted accessory work:
- Upper back: Rows, pull-ups, face pulls
- Legs: Lunges, leg press, leg curls
- Triceps: Dips, extensions, skull crushers
- Biceps: Curls, hammer curls, preacher curls
- Core: Planks, hanging leg raises, ab wheel

## Structuring Your Strength Training Program

### Linear Periodization for Beginners
Ideal for those new to serious training:
- **Weeks 1-4**: 3 sets of 10 reps at 70% 1RM
- **Weeks 5-8**: 4 sets of 8 reps at 75% 1RM
- **Weeks 9-12**: 4 sets of 6 reps at 80% 1RM
- **Weeks 13-16**: 3 sets of 5 reps at 85% 1RM

### Undulating Periodization for Intermediates
Mixes rep ranges within the week for continued progress:
- **Day 1**: Heavy triples (85-90% 1RM)
- **Day 2**: Moderate sets of 6-8 (75-80% 1RM)
- **Day 3**: Light sets of 10-12 (65-70% 1RM)

### Block Periodization for Advanced Lifters
Concentrated phases targeting specific adaptations:
- **Hypertrophy block** (4-6 weeks): Higher volume, moderate intensity
- **Strength block** (4-6 weeks): Moderate volume, high intensity
- **Peaking block** (2-4 weeks): Low volume, near-maximal intensity

- Maintain movement patterns
- Focus on sleep and nutrition

### Daily Recovery Practices
- **Sleep**: 8-9 hours for optimal hormone production
- **Nutrition**: Adequate protein and caloric intake
