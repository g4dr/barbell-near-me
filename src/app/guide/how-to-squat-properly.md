# How to Squat Properly: Master the Foundation of Strength Training

The squat is often called the king of all exercises, and for good reason. When you learn **how to squat properly**, you're building a foundation that translates to nearly every other movement in fitness. Whether you're a beginner or experienced lifter, perfecting your squat form will maximize results while minimizing injury risk.

## Understanding the Barbell Squat

The barbell squat targets your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes more effectively than any other single exercise. It also engages your core, lower back, and calves, making it a true full-body movement. Learning proper squat technique should be every lifter's priority before adding heavy weights.

## Step-by-Step: How to Squat Properly

### Setting Up Your Stance

Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, with toes pointing slightly outward (about 15-30 degrees). This natural stance provides optimal stability and allows your hips to move freely through their range of motion. Your knees should track over your toes throughout the entire movement.

### The Descent Phase

When learning **how to squat properly**, the descent is where most form breakdowns occur. Initiate the movement by breaking at your hips and knees simultaneously, not one before the other. Keep your chest up and back straight as you lower yourself. Aim to get your hips at least parallel to the ground, though deeper squats (below parallel) provide greater muscle activation.

### The Bottom Position

At the bottom of your squat, maintain a neutral spine. Your knees should be in line with your toes, and your heels should remain firmly planted. Avoid rounding your lower back, as this places dangerous stress on your spine. Keep your core braced as if preparing to receive a punch.

### The Ascent Phase

Drive upward by pressing through your heels and extending your hips and knees simultaneously. Keep your chest up throughout the ascent. The path back to standing should be the same path you took down—straight up and down, not forward or backward.

## Common Squat Mistakes to Avoid

Many lifters struggle with their squat form due to these common errors:

- **Knee cave**: When knees collapse inward during the squat. Focus on pushing your knees out against an invisible band.
- **Heel lift**: Rising onto the balls of your feet. This often indicates ankle mobility limitations or improper weight distribution.
- **Excessive forward lean**: While some forward lean is natural, excessive leaning shifts load to your lower back.
- **Rounding the back**: Always maintain a neutral spine, especially when handling heavy weights.

## Building Your Squat Foundation

Start with just the barbell (45 pounds) and focus entirely on form. Add weight gradually only when your technique remains solid across multiple sets. Consider working with a coach or filming yourself to identify form breakdowns that are difficult to feel in real-time.

## Progressing Your Squat Training

Once you've mastered proper squat form, incorporate variations like front squats, pause squats, and squat variations to continue challenging your muscles. These variations target your muscles from different angles and help break through strength plateaus.
