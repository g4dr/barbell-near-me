## Proper Form Fundamentals

### The Core Brace

Before every lift, establish a solid brace:
1. Take a deep breath into your belly
2. Expand your ribcage sideways
3. Tighten your abs as if preparing for impact
4. Maintain this brace throughout the movement
5. Exhale only at the top or end of rep

### Neutral Spine

Maintain natural spinal alignment:
- Don't round your back under load
- Maintain slight natural curve in lower back
- Avoid excessive arching
- Let your skeleton support the weight

### Tempo Control
- Lower phase (eccentric): 2-3 seconds
- Pause at bottom when learning
- Explosive upward phase (concentric)
- Full range of motion

## Beginner Weight Training Program

### Getting Started: 3-Day Full Body

Perform this routine 3 days per week with rest days between:

**Workout A**
| Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|----------|------|------|
| Goblet Squat | 3 | 12 |
| Dumbbell Bench Press | 3 | 12 |
| Seated Cable Row | 3 | 12 |
| Romanian Deadlift | 3 | 12 |
| Overhead Press | 3 | 10 |
| Plank | 3 | 30 sec |

**Workout B**
| Exercise | Sets | Reps |
|----------|------|------|
| Dumbbell Lunges | 3 | 10 each |
| Pull-Ups (assisted) | 3 | 8-10 |
| Dumbbell Row | 3 | 10 each |
| Push-Ups | 3 | max |
| Lateral Raises | 2 | 15 |
| Dead Bug | 3 | 10 each |

## Progression for Beginners

### Linear Progression

Add weight every session when possible:
- Start with weight you can complete with 2 reps in reserve
- Add small increments (2.5-5 pounds upper body, 5-10 pounds lower body)
- When you can't complete reps, hold weight until ready

### Deload Strategy

When progress stalls:
- Reduce weight by 10-15%
- Focus on form and range of motion
- Resume progression after one week

### Tracking Your Progress

Record every workout:
- Exercise performed
- Weight used
- Sets and reps completed
- How you felt during and after

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Going Too Heavy Too Soon
Start lighter than you think necessary. Perfect form builds a foundation for future heavy lifting.

### 2. Neglecting Leg Training
Don't skip leg day. Squats and deadlifts build overall strength and testosterone.

### 3. Ignoring Pain
Sharp pain during exercise signals a problem. Distinguish soreness from injury.

### 4. Training Too Frequently
Beginners need 48-72 hours between full body sessions. More isn't always better.

### 5. Neglecting Warm-Up
Five to ten minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching prevents injury.

### 6. Comparing to Others
Everyone starts somewhere. Focus on your own journey and progress.

### 7. Quitting Too Soon
Results take time. Stay patient and consistent for at least 8-12 weeks before assessing.

## Nutrition for Beginners

### Protein Intake
Aim for 1.6-2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily to support muscle growth.

### Caloric Needs
- Building muscle: Slight caloric surplus
- Fat loss: Moderate caloric deficit while maintaining protein

### Meal Timing
- Pre-workout: Protein and carbs 1-2 hours before
- Post-workout: Protein within 2 hours after

## Recovery Essentials

### Sleep
Aim for 7-9 hours for optimal recovery and hormone production.

### Rest Days
Take at least one full rest day per week initially.

### Active Recovery
Light movement on rest days:
- Walking
- Stretching
- Yoga
- Easy swimming
