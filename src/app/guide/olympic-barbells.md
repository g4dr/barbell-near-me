# Olympic Barbell Guide: Everything You Need to Know

Olympic barbells are precision instruments designed specifically for the snatch, clean and jerk, and other competitive weightlifting movements. Understanding what sets these bars apart will help you choose the right equipment for your training.

## Olympic Barbell Specifications

### Standard Dimensions

- **Shaft Diameter**: 28mm for men, 25mm for women
- **Shaft Length**: 2.2 meters (86.6 inches)
- **Sleeve Diameter**: 50mm (fits standard Olympic plates)
- **Sleeve Length**: 415mm (16.3 inches)
- **Weight**: 20kg for men's bars, 15kg for women's bars

### Key Features

**Dual Knurl Marks**: Olympic bars feature two sets of knurling marks—one for the clean and jerk and one for the snatch. This allows proper hand placement for each lift.

**Smooth Sleeve Rotation**: Quality bearings or bushings allow sleeves to rotate smoothly during lifts, reducing stress on wrists and elbows.

**Moderate Knurling**: Unlike aggressive power bar knurling, Olympic bars use moderate patterns that provide grip without being too harsh for high-rep movements.

**Center Knurling**: Many Olympic bars include a center knurl for added grip during clean movements, though some lifters prefer to remove this for comfort.

## Benefits of Olympic Barbells

Olympic barbells are designed for:
- Dynamic, explosive lifting movements
- Technical skill development
- Competition preparation
- Athletes competing in weightlifting events
