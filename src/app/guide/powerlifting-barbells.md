# Powerlifting Barbell Guide: Max Performance for Maximal Lifts

Powerlifting barbells are purpose-built for the three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. These bars prioritize stability, grip, and the ability to handle extreme loads over the spinning capability needed for Olympic lifts.

## Powerlifting Barbell Specifications

### Standard Dimensions

- **Shaft Diameter**: 29mm for standard IPF-approved bars (some reach 32mm)
- **Shaft Length**: 2.2 meters (86.6 inches)
- **Sleeve Diameter**: 50mm (fits standard Olympic plates)
- **Sleeve Length**: 415mm (16.3 inches)
- **Weight**: 20kg for men's bars
- **Tensile Strength**: Typically 190,000-215,000 PSI for durability

### Key Features

**Aggressive Knurling**: Power bars feature deep, sharp knurling that provides exceptional grip for heavy lifting. The knurling is usually single-position, ensuring consistent hand placement across all lifts.

**Minimal Whip**: Unlike Olympic bars with noticeable flex, power bars have minimal whip to provide a stable platform for maximal attempts.

**Single Knurl Mark**: Power bars typically have one set of knurling marks, positioned for the lifter's preferred stance width in the squat and deadlift.

**High Tensile Strength**: Quality power bars are made from high-strength steel to prevent bending under heavy loads.

## Why Choose a Powerlifting Barbell

Powerlifting barbells excel for:
- Maximal strength training
- Competitive powerlifting
- Heavy compound movements
- Lifters who prioritize stability over mobility
