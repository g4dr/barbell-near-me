# Clean and Jerk Tutorial: The Complete Guide to Olympic Lifting

The clean and jerk is one of the most demanding yet rewarding exercises in all of strength training. This Olympic lift develops explosive power, full-body coordination, and incredible athleticism. Our **clean and jerk tutorial** breaks down this complex movement into manageable components so you can learn it safely and effectively.

## Why Learn the Clean and Jerk?

The clean and jerk tests an athlete's ability to generate explosive force, catch heavy weights under control, and recover quickly between demanding positions. It develops athletic qualities that transfer to nearly every sport and fitness pursuit. Many strength athletes consider it the ultimate measure of total-body power.

## The Clean and Jerk: Two Distinct Movements

The clean and jerk consists of two separate lifts performed in sequence:

1. **The Clean**: Moving the barbell from the floor to the front rack position (on your shoulders)
2. **The Jerk**: Moving the barbell from the front rack to overhead

## Phase 1: The Clean

### The Setup

Position yourself over the bar with feet hip-width apart, toes under or slightly behind the bar. Your grip should be just outside your legs, with arms wrapping around the outside of your thighs. Hinge at your hips, bending knees slightly, and maintain a neutral spine.

### The First Pull

Drive through your entire foot while extending your hips and knees. The bar should remain in contact with or very close to your body as it rises. Keep your shoulders over the bar and your back tight throughout this phase.

### The Transition (Scoop)

As the bar passes your knees, you must "scoop" under the bar by quickly dropping into a front squat position. Your elbows rotate around the bar to catch it in the front rack position. This happens in a fraction of a second for advanced lifters.

### The Catch

Catch the bar in a front squat position, with elbows high and upper arms parallel to the floor. The bar rests on your shoulders and collarbone, not directly on your sternum. Stand up to complete the clean.

## Phase 2: The Jerk

### The Jerk Dip

From the front rack position, perform a small dip by bending your knees about 3-4 inches. This dip must be fast, vertical, and well-timed to generate upward momentum.

### The Drive

As you begin to extend from the dip, aggressively push the floor away with your legs while simultaneously pressing the bar upward with your arms. Your torso should remain upright throughout the drive.

### The Split

As the bar reaches its highest point, split your legs into a lunge position—front leg forward, back leg back. This creates space for the bar to travel overhead while lowering your body to catch it securely.

### The Lockout

With the bar overhead, both legs should be bent at approximately 90 degrees, with your torso upright. Stand up to full extension, bringing your feet together to complete the jerk.

## Clean and Jerk Tutorial: Progression Tips

### Start with the Basics

Before attempting the full clean and jerk, master these prerequisite movements:
- Front squat to full depth
- Hang cleans for position practice
- Push presses for overhead stability
- Split squats for mobility and strength

### Film Your Lifts

The clean and jerk happens too fast to feel all your technical errors. Video analysis is essential for identifying areas needing improvement.

### Use Light Weights Initially

Olympic lifting requires developing new neuromuscular patterns. Practice with an empty bar (or even a PVC pipe) until the movement feels natural before adding meaningful weight.
