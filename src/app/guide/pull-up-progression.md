# Pull-Up Progression: Your Complete Guide to Mastering the Pull-Up

The pull-up is one of the most impressive displays of upper body strength, yet many people struggle to complete even one rep. This **pull-up progression** guide will take you from being unable to do a single pull-up to performing multiple reps with ease.

## Why Pull-Ups Matter

Pull-ups develop your latissimus dorsi, biceps, and entire back musculature while demanding significant core engagement. They improve grip strength, shoulder health, and upper body pulling power. Mastering pull-ups opens the door to more advanced movements like muscle-ups and weighted pull-ups.

## Assessment: Where Are You Starting?

Before beginning your pull-up progression, honestly assess your current ability:

**Level 0**: Cannot hang from the bar with arms extended
**Level 1**: Can hang but cannot pull
**Level 2**: Can do partial range of motion reps
**Level 3**: Can complete 1-5 pull-ups
**Level 4**: Can do 5+ pull-ups (ready for progressions)

## Pull-Up Progression: Building From Zero

### Phase 1: Hang and Grip Strength

Before attempting to pull, you must build grip strength and tolerance for hanging. Practice dead hangs daily, working up to 60 seconds of continuous hanging.

**Target**: Hang for 60 seconds total across multiple sets

### Phase 2: Scapular Control

Learn to engage your back muscles before pulling. Practice scapular pulls by hanging from the bar and pulling your shoulder blades down and together without bending your elbows.

**Target**: 3 sets of 10-15 scapular pulls

### Phase 3: Negatives (Eccentics)

Jump to the top position of a pull-up and lower yourself under control. This eccentric-focused training builds strength in the pulling pattern.

**Target**: 3 sets of 5-8 slow negatives (5+ seconds descent)

### Phase 4: Band-Assisted Pull-Ups

Use a resistance band to assist your pull-ups. Loop the band around your knee or foot to provide upward momentum. Use the thickest band that still allows you to perform quality reps.

**Target**: 3 sets of 5-8 assisted pull-ups

### Phase 5: Bodyweight Pull-Ups

With sufficient preparation, attempt your first unassisted pull-up. Focus on completing the rep with good form rather than rushing.

**Target**: 3 sets of 3-5 pull-ups

## Pull-Up Progression: Advancing Your Performance

### Adding Reps

Once you can do 3 sets of 5, add one rep to each set weekly until you reach your goal number.

### Weighted Pull-Ups

Attach weight using a dip belt or hold a dumbbell between your feet. This increases strength and muscle development.

### Variation Training

Once you've mastered the standard pull-up, explore variations:
- Chin-ups (palms facing you)
- Wide grip pull-ups
- Close grip pull-ups
- Commando pull-ups

## Common Pull-Up Mistakes

- **Using momentum**: Avoid kipping unless specifically training for CrossFit-style pull-ups.
- **Partial range of motion**: Always pull to full lockout and lower to dead hang.
- **Neglecting negatives**: Eccentric training is crucial for building strength.
- **Inconsistent practice**: Daily practice yields the fastest progress.
